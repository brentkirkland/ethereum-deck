# ethereum-deck

This project aims to build a decentralized ticketing platform for service industry businesses.

The project is in part with (blockcolor smart contract)[https://github.com/brentkirkland/blockcolor].

## To Run:
* Please have IPFS running locally.
* Deploy the (blockcolor smart contract)[https://github.com/brentkirkland/blockcolor] contracts to testnet.
* `yarn install && yarn start`

## TODO:
* Remove unused variables.
* Rename components to match new contract.
* Get an accessible IPFS node running so others can demo this.
* Get color stages working. Stages allow you to pass on a ticket to different departments / specialist.
* Implement routes to view complete ticket (from inception to end).
* Smooth out UI.
